                                Photo I took in 2017 with my first mobile phone. That year, I also got my first computer
                                with Ubuntu as the operating system and started exploring it out of curiosity. This
                                curiosity led me to explore the Linux terminal and take my first steps with very basic
                                commands, thus discovering this world.

                                Photo of "Edificio Europa", Capgemini’s headquarters in Valencia. During my training in
                                multiplatform app development, the highlight was doing my internship there, working in a professional
                                environment within a real team. I was able to apply my knowledge in frontend, backend,
                                and the Scrum agile methodology on a project for Carrefour. At the end, I received a
                                recommendation from the project manager to the company and human resources, which opened
                                the door for me to continue with them.
                                I have completed the first year of Computer Engineering, during that year I came to
                                conclussion
                                that university is not the only path and I prefer practical experience. Nevertheless my
                                idea is to continue
                                training, both studying on my own and working.

                        ideas that connect back to my projects.

                        Spending time in nature—walking or just thinking—is essential for me, as it helps me solve
